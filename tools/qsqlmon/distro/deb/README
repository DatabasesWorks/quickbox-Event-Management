*********** How to build deb packages **********

	Firstly this describes the easiest way how to build an deb package
and if i'm not mistaking it just works for ubuntu distributions

	In the same directory as this file you'll find
folder /qsqlmon
It has the folowing structure:

└── DEBIAN
    ├── control
    └── postinst
└── usr
    ├── bin
    ├── lib
    └── share
	In 'control' file is basically a descriptor for the package.
Here you declare its name, dependecies and so on.
'postinst' file is a not a mandatory one and  as its name suggests
you declare here scripts to be executed after installation of you package

	Under DEBIAN folder you create a so called 'fake root', which contains folders and files exactly how you want them to be installed on the 
file system.

	To create the deb package use:
	dpkg -b <project_folder> pakage_name.deb

for example:
	dpkg -b qsqlmon/ qsqlmon-1.3.0.ubuntu-10.0.4.i386.deb
