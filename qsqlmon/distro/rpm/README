With the help of qsqlmon.spec you can build rpm packages for any distribution of Fedora,
openSUSE, centOS and Red Hat for any architecture 32bit or 64bit. 

**********BUILDING THE RPM FOR FEDORA*************

1.In a directory in your home directory—say, $HOME/qsqlmon—create five subdirectories:

    * BUILD. BUILD is used as scratch space to actually compile the software.
    * RPMS. RPMS contains the binary RPM that rpmbuild builds.
    * SOURCES. SOURCES is for source code.
    * SPECS. SPECS contains your spec file or files—one spec file per RPM you want to build.
    * SRPMS. SRPMS contains the source RPM built during the process.

2.Edit the qsqlmon.spec file. 
Change first line:
%define projdir  /home/radu/Documents/university/osp/qsqlmon/qsqlmon
to point to where the sources of qsqlmon are

3.To build it the rpm, use 'rpmbuild' utility 
$rpmbuild -v -bb --clean SPECS/qsqlmon.spec

4. You will find the rpm in your user directory in 'rpmbuild' directory
For example: /home/radu/rpmbuild/RPMS
